****************

Example of a script for analyzing a corpus of sounds. It demonstrates the sequences of calls that are made in order to build the corpus.

To run
------

* Copy the example folder from the corpusdb folder to your user folder.
* cd to the directory containing this file. (~/testcorpus, or wherever you put it)
* run ``python analysis_example.py``

It will populate several folders with files generated by the analysis process. This is what the folder structure should look like pre-analysis.
	::
		/.
		/snd/36047_dobroide.wav
		/snd/36818_cajo.wav
		/osc
		/json
		...
		.sc file(s) - with Synthdefs
		.py file(s) - like this one

After analysis, there will be ``.osc`` files in the ``/osc`` directory. ``md`` directories will be created where needed to hold raw metadata files. CorpusDB relies on this structure and expects to find files in these particular places. If you are setting up your own corpus, you will need to create snd, osc, and json folders yourself in a folder as above. 

The export-JSON function will use the json directory.


A really simple example
=======================

::
	anchorpath = '/Users/kfl/comp/supercollider/7.untitled'
	sndpath = os.path.join(anchorpath, 'snd')
	corpus = corpusdb.CorpusDB(anchorpath)

	f = os.path.join(anchorpath, 'snd', '2.wav')
	tval = 1
	node = corpus.add_sound_file(filename=os.path.basename(f), srcFileID=None, tratio=tval, sfGrpID=0)

	sfid = node.sfid
	print '2. sfid: ', sfid

	corpus.analyze_sound_file(os.path.basename(f), sfid, tratio=tval)
	powers, mfccs = corpus.get_raw_metadata(sfid)

	sfdur = (corpus.sftree.nodes[sfid].duration / tval)
	cut_list = findCutPoints2(sfid, mfcccs)

etc...
